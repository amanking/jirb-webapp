## Defunct
This code base is not actively maintained and is kept here for archival purposes.

In Dec 2007, this project took birth as an experiment (aka "spike") to play around with JRuby. 
It tries to mimic a simple in-browser interpreter.

The code base was improved upon later, to not use a full MVC, but DWR instead. The improved code base is hosted at
[bitbucket.org/amanking/jirb-online](https://bitbucket.org/amanking/jirb-online) and deployed at 
[jirbonline.appspot.com](http://jirbonline.appspot.com)
